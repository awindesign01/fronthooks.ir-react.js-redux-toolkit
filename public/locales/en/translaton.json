   "WIF": "What is front-end ?",
   "frontend_intro": "Let me tell you very personally and far from clich√©d definitions, what is front-end? Who does what? Every website or application has two basic parts. One side of the server that the user does not see and one side of the user that becomes the appearance of the site. You guessed it right, the things we do directly and see are called front sites. Like headers, footers, the main content of the site, registration forms, etc., all of which are the responsibility of the front-end developer. With the advent of attractive JavaScript frameworks such as vue.js and the React library (react.js), the task of Front has become much heavier, and much of the work that used to be done by a back-end developer is now done by Front and Kara. Maidan and this is why Front's employment market has become very hot and Front's salaries have increased a lot and everyone is looking for experts in this field. Congratulations on the mysterious and fascinating world of web programming, and especially Front. Use our experience and we are proud to be with you until you enter the job market.",

   "text_footer": "I own Sahib Mohammadi, a web developer. I have been working as a programmer since 1993 and I have been working professionally as a front developer in startups and online exchanges for more than three years. Over the years, I have experienced many challenges in the field of programming, both as freelance work on external sites and as a team. I spent a lot of money and time to get training in the most reputable courses of foreign sites. All FrontHooks training is based on three principles: quality, project-oriented and up-to-date courses, lifetime support with free updates and refunds in case of any dissatisfaction. I hope Frant Hooks is a good companion for you to enter the job market and the world of programming. You can contact me via Instagram, Telegram or LinkedIn",
